During 2017s [Google Developer Days Europe](https://developers.google.com/events/gdd-europe/) Florina Muntenescu gave this great talk explaining [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html). It is only 15 minutes long (last 5 minutes are about new
`android.support.v7.recyclerview.extensions`) and addresses all the issues I encountered using it in a very clear way. Highly recommended watch.
