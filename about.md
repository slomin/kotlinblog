Hi, my name is Jan Slominski and I am a mobile developer. In my current work, I mostly use Java and Swift with some occasional JavaScript. In the past, I programmed in various languages, including C#, Objective-C, Python, Delphi and Ruby. Since 2016 I also develop an increasing portion of my code in Kotlin.

On this blog I'm going to write mostly about Kotlin from the perspective of an experienced Android developer accustomed to Java programming language. I will also tackle some other areas of my professional career and interests, such as iOS development, [FinTech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology) IoT/Android Things and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).  


This blog is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with [Hyde theme](http://hyde.getpoole.com).
